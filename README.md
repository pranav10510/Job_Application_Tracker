# Job Tracker - Email Scanner & Application Manager

A smart job application tracker that automatically scans your Gmail for job-related emails and organizes them using AI analysis. Built with Flask, Gmail API, and Ollama AI.

## 🌟 Features

- **Automatic Email Scanning**: Scans Gmail for job applications, confirmations, and responses
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Ollama (llama3.2:3b) to categorize and extract job information
- **Real-time Web Interface**: Modern web UI with progress tracking
- **Smart Filtering**: Filters by status (Applied, Interview, Offer, etc.)
- **Database Storage**: SQLite database to track all applications
- **Customizable Search**: Configurable keywords and date ranges

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Gmail account with API access
- Ollama installed locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Job_Tracker
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Gmail API

#### Step 1: Enable Gmail API
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search for "Gmail API"
   - Click "Enable"

#### Step 2: Create OAuth Credentials
1. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
3. Choose "Desktop Application"
4. Download the credentials JSON file
5. **Rename it to `credentials.json`** and place it in the project root

### 4. Set Up Ollama AI

#### Install Ollama
```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# On Windows: Download from https://ollama.ai/download
```

#### Install the AI Model
```bash
# Install the lightweight model (recommended)
ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Or install Mistral (larger, slower)
ollama pull mistral:7b
```

#### Start Ollama Service
```bash
ollama serve
```

### 5. First-Time Gmail Authentication

**IMPORTANT**: You must authenticate Gmail via command line first:

```bash
# Run the email fetcher directly
python email_fetcher.py
```

This will:
1. Show you a Google authorization URL
2. Open the URL in your browser
3. Click "Allow" to authorize the app
4. Copy the redirect URL from browser (even if it shows "This site can't be reached")
5. Paste the full URL when prompted

The authentication token will be saved as `token.pkl` for future use.

### 6. Start the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5000**

## 🔧 Configuration

### Email Keywords
Edit `config.py` to customize job-related keywords:

```python
JOB_KEYWORDS = [
    "application", "applied", "position", "role", "job",
    "interview", "assessment", "opportunity", "linkedin",
    "thank you for applying", "application received",
    "noreply", "jobs-noreply", "recruiting"
]
```

### AI Model Selection
In `ai_analyzer.py`, you can change the model:

```python
MODEL_NAME = "llama3.2:3b"  # Fast, lightweight
# MODEL_NAME = "mistral:7b"  # Slower but more accurate
```

### Scan Period
Default scan looks back 60 days. Change in `config.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_DAYS_BACK = 60  # Adjust as needed
```

## 📱 Usage

1. **Launch the Web Interface**: Visit http://localhost:5000
2. **Start Scanning**: Click "Launch Scan" button
3. **Choose Time Range**: Select from 5 days to 120 days back
4. **Monitor Progress**: Real-time progress bar and status updates
5. **Review Results**: Filter by status, update applications, add notes

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Token has been expired or revoked"
```bash
# Remove expired token and re-authenticate
rm token.pkl
python email_fetcher.py
```

#### "Ollama not running"
```bash
# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Check if model is installed
ollama list
```

#### "Gmail API not enabled"
- Ensure Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Check that `credentials.json` is in the project root
- Verify OAuth consent screen is configured

#### Slow AI Analysis
- Switch to faster model: `MODEL_NAME = "llama3.2:3b"`
- The app shows "may take 1-2 min per email" - this is normal
- Progress updates every email processed

#### No Emails Found
- Check date range (try more days back)
- Verify keywords in `config.py` match your emails
- Ensure Gmail account has job-related emails in the specified period

### Performance Tips

- **Use llama3.2:3b** for faster analysis (recommended)
- **Scan shorter periods** first (5-30 days) to test
- **Run during off-peak hours** for better AI performance
- **Close other heavy applications** while scanning
